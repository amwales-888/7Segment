Simple Large 7Segment Display

Who doesn't love big 7Segment displays?
Modelled the hardware in solidworks, printed on BambuLabs P1S. PCBs designed in KiCAD and boards manufactured by JLPCB.
The microcontroller I am using is a dsPIC33CK and it is interfaced to the WS2812 chips through DMA->SPI. It took quite a bit of fiddling to get the DMA->SPI working.
